# Sugar-Manuifacturing
Sugar is produced mainly from sugarcane or sugar beet. The plants are crushed to extract juice, which is then purified using lime and carbon dioxide. The clean juice is evaporated to form a thick syrup, then crystallized to separate sugar crystals from molasses. The crystals are centrifuged, dried, and refined to make white sugar.
